Section LT.

Theorem strong_induction :
  forall P : nat -> Prop,
    (forall n, (forall k, (k < n)%nat -> P k) -> P n) ->
    forall n, P n.
Proof.
intros P H n.
assert (forall k, (k < S n)%nat -> P k).
induction n.
intros k Hk.
replace k with 0%nat.
apply H.
intros m Hm; contradict Hm.
apply Nat.nlt_0_r.
generalize Hk; case k; trivial.
intros m Hm; contradict Hm.
apply Nat.le_ngt.
now auto with arith.
intros k Hk.
apply H.
intros m Hm.
apply IHn.
apply Nat.lt_le_trans with (1:=Hm).
now apply Nat.succ_le_mono.
apply H0.
apply le_n.
Qed.

Lemma ifflr {P} {Q} (h : P <-> Q) : P -> Q.
Proof.
  now destruct h as [pimqp _].
Qed.

Lemma iffrl {P} {Q} : P <-> Q -> Q -> P.
Proof.
  now intros [_ QimpP].
Qed.
End LT.
